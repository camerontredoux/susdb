# SusDB

Upload sus (as in suspicious or blatantly stupid) messages to a Planetscale database from your Discord server.

This bot was created in hopes of preventing any stupid messages from being sent in our Discord server. People like to send messages that are inappropriate and then immediately delete them. With this bot, you can right click on someone's message to open a context menu interaction with an option to upload their message to a database, so even if they delete the message it is available in perpetuity.

This is mostly for fun, since the server owner is the most prolific poster of sus messages. All messages saved and uploaded to our database will be viewable by server members on the [team's](https://tlmbz.com) website.
